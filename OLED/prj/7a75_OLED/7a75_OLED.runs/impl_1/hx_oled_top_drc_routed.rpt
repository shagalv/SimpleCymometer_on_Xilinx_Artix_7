2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net oled_clear/spi_data_reg[7]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin oled_clear/spi_data_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell oled_clear/spi_data_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net oled_clear/spi_send_reg_i_2__0_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin oled_clear/spi_send_reg_i_2__0/O, cell oled_clear/spi_send_reg_i_2__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net oled_write_data/spi_data_reg[7]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin oled_write_data/spi_data_reg[7]_i_1/O, cell oled_write_data/spi_data_reg[7]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net oled_write_data/spi_send_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin oled_write_data/spi_send_reg_i_2/O, cell oled_write_data/spi_send_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net spi_send_reg_i_2__1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin spi_send_reg_i_2__1/O, cell spi_send_reg_i_2__1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net write_start_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin write_start_reg_i_2/O, cell write_start_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
